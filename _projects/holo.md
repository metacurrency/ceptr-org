   <b>Stage of Development:</b> Alpha Release, (Beta expected Q3 2024), [Original Crowdfunding](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/holo-the-peer-to-peer-internet-has-arrived-money-community).
</div>

## Overview

[Holo](holo.host) is a platform that gives web users access to decentralized [Holochain](/projects/holochain) applications. Developers use Holo with their Holochain applications to allow easy access from a browser. End users can then access decentralised apps by just typing in a URL.  No installation of the Holochain software required.

People who do install a Holochain node, or buy a dedicated device, can run Holo hosting software. These hosts earn a Holo hosting cryptocurrency (HoloFuel) for providing their extra computing capacity to the network. Developers pay hosts in Holo fuel to service users without their own Holochain node.

## Crowdfunding

We are currently [crowdfunding](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/holo-the-peer-to-peer-internet-has-arrived-money-community)  to raise money to build out the Holo platform, and to disseminate hosting devices and create a vibrant hosting community.

Through this campaign we're offering the Holoport -- a device that makes it easy to join a community of hosters and earn Holo fuel, a mutual-credit cryptocurrency.  The crowdfunding also includes "perks" where our team will come and run a hackathon in your community, or even build a prototype Holochain application.

## Apps Ecosystem
Our community has created a [directory of applications being built on Holochain](https://www.happenings.community/database) which also may be available for Holo hosting. Please check out all the cool things being built!
