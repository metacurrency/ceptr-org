# Not Found

That page doesn't exist on this site!

<script>
  // on 2016-02-01 GitHub Pages upgraded to Jekyll3, which broke all blog posts with trailing slashes
  // and there are tons of links out there on the web to posts with a trailing slash, so can't ignore it
  var url = location.href;
  if(url.substr(url.length - 1) === '/') {
    window.location = url.substr(0, url.length - 1);
  }
</script>
